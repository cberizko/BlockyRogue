"Shape the World" - You are some irregular shape in an initially geometric perfect world. Wandering an endless plane, you cause mutations on yourself and the other shapes. This would need to be endless world, randomly generating everything. The bullets can be whatever, probably random squiggles. The mutations alter your character and makes the geometric shapes, AKA the enemy, irregular instead of perfect geometric shapes. Final Boss: the Circle.
